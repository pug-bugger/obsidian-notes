#Personal 
Yesterday I experienced firsthand that, before starting a project or product, a developer should look for existing solutions, apps, or services instead of immediately building their own. I spent a fair amount of time creating an app for vehicle owners to help them manage maintenance information about their cars.  
Now I’ve discovered Carone, which already does exactly what I wanted to build. Maybe that’s not a bad thing—it’s just a sign that I should move in a slightly different direction.

If do - then better.
