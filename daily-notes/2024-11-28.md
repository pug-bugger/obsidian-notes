- **Create Task Records:**
    
    - Create a few **Task__c** records in Salesforce.
- **Create Task History Records:**
    
    - For each **Task__c**, create associated **Task_History__c** records.
- **Execute Archiving Script:**
    
    - Run the following script:
        
        apex
        
        Copy code
        
        `Database.executeBatch(new BATCH_ArchiveTaskHistory(1), 1000);`
        
- **Validate Archiving Results:**
    
    - Check the values of the **Task__c.Task_Histories__c** field to ensure the related task histories have been archived.
    - Verify that the **Archived__c** field on the **Task_History__c** records is set to `true`.
- **Test Additional Archiving:**
    
    - Create new **Task_History__c** records for one of the previously created tasks.
    - Re-run the archiving script:
        
        apex
        
        Copy code
        
        `Database.executeBatch(new BATCH_ArchiveTaskHistory(1), 1000);`
        
    - Verify that the new task histories are archived and that all related values are updated correctly.
