Simple app to track logistic business, exactly is the truck insurance, technical inspection and some custom schedules or reminders. App should have login/registration, online database (it can be firebase) and local storage. App should push notifications with reminders automatically to remind about deadlines. Design minimalistic white/black and maybe grey, use shadcn.

For now I just will implement app core functionality, without login, online database storage and - just data management in local storage and push notifications.
