- Preparing to code review.
- About left to drive: I can't guaranty left to drive calculation correct, because of here are several things that affects calculations. Now use what one getDistanceLeftMap from accepted task to last planned task. There when Live_Distance_Left is null on not a number type, then it takes Planned_Distance_m__c. Below is driven and distance number, distance is always Planned_Distance_m__c and driven is the value from getDistanceLeftMap or if not exist then Planned_Distance_m__c. Maybe bug in new functionality are the result of wrong live left distance data?
- Discussed with Paulius task progress cmp. Need to improve 1 percent display progress line handler, replace cardIconMobile cmp by svg provider cmp.
- Replacing and updating svg-provider in trip and task row.
- Fixing tooltip react zone.
