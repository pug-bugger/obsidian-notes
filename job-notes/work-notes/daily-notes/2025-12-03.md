### Task
[RT-379 Tripų skaidymas, kad būtų matomi taskai iš karto ir kad nereikėtų papi...](https://bcline.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/a0NSZ00000FKsgL2AT/view)
- Try to optimize task row loading  time.
*stand-up chat*
- Cleaning code from repeated calculations (left to drive)
- Left to drive calculation was excessive.
*lunch time*
- Discussed task row rendering performance with Paulius.
- Find out that html iteration in task row are slow. Think how to speed up this place (bad research results, html just calls getter method).
- It's hard to say what the reason is that it takes a long time, depends on the computer ram load, but +- with getters and custom settings are similar.
- No, with getters speed almost 2 times faster than with dynamic custom setting. Investigating this half to optimize if possible.
- Researching with gemini and cursor gpt5, last chance to check solution from ai.
