### Task
[kai ateina taskas su 0 koord., tai pasiimti koordinates pgl adresą](https://bcline.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/a0NSZ00000HDN532AH/view)
- How I learned it is not possible to map not committed records (without Ids) and not sure how to implement it with external ids for example, maybe possible but not sure.
*stand-up meet + discussed task plan*
[Minusuoti kilometrus iš straight line taskų](https://bcline.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/a0NSZ00000GmPMH2A3/view)
- Adding check for isStraightLine and calculate Planned_Distance_m__c without this type distance.
- Added check for isStraightLine, replacing what type task distances with 0.
- Wrote test case and created PR to partial.
[(Bug) RT-647 Konsolėje stipriai lagina custom report komponentas](https://bcline.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/a0NSZ00000LGtvh2AD/view)
- Testing in sandbox and in production.
- In partial and sandbox the loading time is not sensitive, but in production is too obvious.
- Try to debug and increase performance.
