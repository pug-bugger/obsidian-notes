### Task
[RT-781 nebenotifikuoti konsolėje, kai mažai kuro + suplanuotas užsipylimas](https://bcline.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/a0NSZ00000LfOOr2AN/view)
- Searching for places where critical fuel level are calculating.
- Updating calculation logic
*stand-up meet*
- Seem like critical fuel and/or adbue level calculation are only in console.
- Separating display 20% and detect on 0% logic (now it all are in one place).
*lunch time*
- Updated calculation and display logic, it works good in fuel window, but not sure about trip planner window, so need more time to test and fix if required.
